# NeuroLit

# A Visualization and Prediction Tool for Reading Research
Our group aims to implement machine learning to examine the relationship between qualitative survey responses given by parents/guardians and the quantitative reading skill of their children.  Data from the [UW Reading & Dyslexia Research Program (UW RDRP)](https://github.com/UWSEDS-aut17/uwseds-group-neurolit.git) will be used.

**Questions posed:**
* Can we create a tool that will produce fast, easy, and presentation-worthy visualizations of relationships in our data?
* Using our survey data, do parent perceptions of reading difficulty correlate with assessed reading skill?
* Is our reading assessment able to predict the diagnosis of reading disability?
