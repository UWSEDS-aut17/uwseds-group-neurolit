# NeuroLit

# A Visualization and Prediction Tool for Reading Research
Our group aims to implement machine learning to examine the relationship between qualitative survey responses given by parents/guardians and the quantitative reading skill of their children.  Data from the [UW Reading & Dyslexia Research Program (UW RDRP)](https://github.com/UWSEDS-aut17/uwseds-group-neurolit.git) will be used.

**Questions posed:**
* Can we create a tool that will produce fast, easy, and presentation-worthy visualizations of relationships in our data?
* Using our survey data, do parent perceptions of reading difficulty correlate with assessed reading skill?
* Is our reading assessment able to predict the diagnosis of reading disability?

## Quick Start Guide

1. Run the dash_visualization notebook to open our interactable visualization app powered by Dash

    a. Choose predictor variables and an outcome variable to explore the data!
    
2. Open the predict notebook, customize the variables using the inline instructions, and run it

    b. Use our machine learning narrative to illustrate the power and validity of the reading measures
    
3. Check out the examples in the examples folder for inspiration!
